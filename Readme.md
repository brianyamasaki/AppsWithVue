# Introduction to Web Apps with Vue

We're starting from basically nothing but HTML and working our way up to a full working web application.

We'll be using [Vue](www.vuejs.org) as your first introduction to web programming. We can use as little of it, or as much of it as we'd like, unlike other frameworks that demand complete control.

## Development Tools

You'll need the following tools to start development.

- Install and manage source code using [git](www.git-scm.org)
- Create a free account at [GitHub](www.github.com).
- You'll need [the node ecosystem](www.nodejs.org) to download tools, frameworks and code libraries. Install node on your computer.
- I recommend Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as your editor. Download and install it on your computer.
- Learn how to use your terminal program for the command line.

## How to start development

1. Start your terminal program. Navigate to a directory where you want to start development. I usually create a directory called `projects`, then create all my projects under that.
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/brianyamasaki/`. This will download the source code to your machine.

The index.html at the base directory has no JavaScript, it's just a simple file with links to each of the versions.

## V0

We're starting with a simple HTML file with almost no styling, but a very basic application inside.

### The Code

Inside the HTML {{message}} is to be replaced by the contents of that named variable in the &lt;script&gt; statement.

## V1

We're adding a CSS framework called Bootstrap to help layout our web page.
